Game Developer/Software Engineer
--------------------------------

My intereast in gaming started at a very young age because I would often play Halo with my grandfather. Ever since, gaming has been my main source of media entertainment and has helped develop me into the person I am today. I only became interested in developing games myself when I switched my major from Physical Therapy to a Computer Science degree and I took my first programming class. From that moment I knew I wanted to make games for a living and share my love of gaming with as many people as I can.

After earning my A.S. degree in Programming and Analysis, I went on to earn a B.S. degree in Game Development from Full Sail University. There I mainly worked on the AI for the enemies in the games we made and had a ton of fun doing it. I typically prefer singleplayer games so I understand how important it is to have fun and engaging enemies to defeat, otherwise the gameplay becomes boring and stale very quickly.

I most recently worked at Otisco Studios, a small indie company based in Central Florida made up of other passionate developers and artits trying to breakout into the industry. At Otisco, I was the lead programmer and was in charge of setting up the project and also developing the weapon mechanics and the parkour mechanics as well as assisting the 3D artists with importing their art into the game as usable assets.

While gaming is my main way to spend my free time, I also love watching football and anything Marvel related, hobbies I happily get to share with my wife.
